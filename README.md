# flowershop

This is project I have created for series of video tutorials on [Symphony CMS](http://www.getsymphony.com/)

You can find the playlist over here :

If you want to manually pull project and import database, than here is the login info (admin path is `/secret`) : 

+ username : user
+ password : pass

But I suggest you install it from ensemble :
